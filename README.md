# State-of-the-art-ML-project-Firewall-Dataset

This study on device action decision prediction of logs kept by the network firewall is a state-of-the-art solution with 99.847% accuracy.
Dataset includes Source Port, Destination Port, NAT Source Port, NAT Destination Port, Bytes, Bytes Sent, Bytes Received, Packets, Elapsed Time (sec), 
pkts_sent, pkts_received features and Action class. The aim is to correctly predict the allow, drop, deny and reset-both actions in the Action class. 
In this context, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms were examined separately and their performances were evaluated and compared.
